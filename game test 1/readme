1)You can host it to server and run index.php
2)Click 'next pattern' button to view the next pattern/changes

Note: comment out the below code to automatically allow the patterns to get change.(In future this can handle using Ajax in better way to avoid page refresh
)
/*
$page = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];
$sec = "1";
*/


Now the default grid dimension is set to 15. And in the future, we can have an input field to allow the user to change it.
